# QGIS (project files)

QGIS project files and styles used for analysis/mapping live here for reference.

Notes:

- QGIS `.qgz` projects typically store **paths to datasets**, not the datasets themselves. After downloading the data folder from Drive (see `DATA_SOURCES.md`), you will likely need to relink missing layers.
- Styles (`.qml`) can be re-used across projects (e.g., for Space Syntax colour ramps).
