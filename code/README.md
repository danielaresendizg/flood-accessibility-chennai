# Code (minimal)

This project is primarily a GIS + Space Syntax workflow (DepthmapX + QGIS). Any lightweight scripts used for preprocessing or postprocessing can be added here.

Suggested structure:

```
code/
├── qgis/          # QGIS project notes, styles, processing steps
└── python/        # Optional scripts (e.g., cleaning, joins, exports)
```
