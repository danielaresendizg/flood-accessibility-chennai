This paper demonstrates a transferable workflow to quantify accessibility loss under flood disruption and to derive priority intervention corridors.

Future work can extend the approach with scenario ensembles, sensitivity tests on disruption thresholds, and validation against observed service outages and travel constraints during flood events.
