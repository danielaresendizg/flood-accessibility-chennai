The study focuses on the Adyar River basin and adjacent urbanised areas of Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

Data layers include: (i) street network data derived from OpenStreetMap; (ii) flood inundation layers representing an extreme event / return period scenario; (iii) land use and settlement context layers; and (iv) candidate shelter locations and key services used to evaluate accessibility under disruption.

All large geospatial datasets are shared via Google Drive (see the repository file \texttt{DATA\_SOURCES.md}).
