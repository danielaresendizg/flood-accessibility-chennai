The workflow combines network-based accessibility metrics with flood exposure overlays.

\subsection*{Space Syntax accessibility}
Segment-based analyses were used to compute accessibility proxies (e.g., global and local measures at multiple radii) for the street network.

\subsection*{Flood disruption overlay}
A flood scenario layer was intersected with the street network to identify segments impacted by inundation. Accessibility was recalculated under disrupted conditions to quantify loss patterns.

\subsection*{Targeting and prioritisation}
Priority zones and corridors were identified by combining accessibility loss with population density proxies, safe-zone indicators, and the distribution of shelters and critical services.
